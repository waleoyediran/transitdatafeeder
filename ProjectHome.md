The TransitDataFeeder open source project is an effort to develop and maintain an application that provides a web-based interface for creating and maintaining transit geospatial, schedule, calendar, and fare information in the [General Transit Feed Specification](http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.html).

This is the primary project and repository for the Transit Data Feeder.

Funding for the initial development project is provided through the "Google Transit Data Tool for Small Transit Agencies" by the [Transit IDEA program](http://www.trb.org/IDEAProgram/Public/IDEATransit.aspx) of the Transportation Research Board.  The "Google Transit Data Tool for Small Transit Agencies" project is a collaboration between the IDEA Project team, [PEMCCO](http://www.pemcco.com/), [SingleMind Consulting](http://singlemindconsulting.com/) and [Trillium Solutions](http://www.trilliumtransit.com/).

Open source software allows the "source code" to be accessed by anyone.  This source code is the language from which running version of the software can be complied.

These are the steps to download the source code:

1.) Visit the "Checkout code" page at the transitatafeeder project site for instructions.  The URL for this page is at http://code.google.com/p/transitdatafeeder/source/checkout

2.) Users will need subversion client software to view and download code.  More information is available here: http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/SubversionFAQ
